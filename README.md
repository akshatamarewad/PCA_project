## Principal Component Analysis

- This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding and simplifying data. It explores key insights into the dataset through EDA and applies PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.
## Objectives:

- Perform EDA to uncover patterns, distributions, and correlations in the dataset.

- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction and visualization.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Analyze and visualize data distributions.

- Handle missing values and identify key insights.

## Principal Component Analysis(PCA):

- Standardize the dataset.

- Reduce dimensionality while preserving significant variance.

- Visualize principal components.

## Scatterplot Analysis:

- In the label #4 as being the most separated group.

- implying it's the most distinct, similar situation for #2, #6 and #9.

- The legend indicates multiple categories (0 to 9), with overlap in some areas, potentially highlighting regions of similarity.

## Prerequisites:

- Python 3.x

- Required Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Install necessary libraries:

## Conclusion:

- This project successfully demonstrated the use of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and visualization. Scatterplot analysis revealed distinct groupings and patterns within the dataset, highlighting its structure and variance. The results show how PCA effectively simplifies complex data while preserving key information, making it a powerful tool for understanding high-dimensional datasets.
